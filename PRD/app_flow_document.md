# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user first discovers the app, they are greeted by a clean and simple landing page. On this page, users are invited to log in or register, with the primary method being Google account authentication. The process is straightforward: upon clicking the sign-in or sign-up button, the user is redirected to Google’s secure login page where the necessary credentials are entered. Once authenticated, the app confirms the user’s identity and directs them into an onboarding process. During onboarding, the user is informed of the different tiers available within the platform, with free users receiving a daily conversation limit of ten interactions and paid users enjoying unlimited exchanges along with full course content access. For users who may have trouble logging in, the app provides options for password recovery and clear instructions on what to do if the account details are lost. Additionally, while Google sign-in is the primary authentication method, any alternative methods are seamlessly integrated, ensuring that every new user’s entry into the application is as smooth and intuitive as possible.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After the authentication process, users are immediately transitioned into the main dashboard, which serves as the central hub of the application. Built using Node.js for a responsive and interactive UI, the dashboard displays a well-organized layout with clear navigational elements like header menus and sidebars. Here, users can easily locate the different sections of the app such as course materials, conversational AI features, voice dialogue interfaces, and note-taking modules. The dashboard presents course content plainly, making it easy for students to begin interacting with the learning material right away. Whether a user wants to record class notes or engage in an interactive conversation with the AI, the dashboard acts as the starting point from which all other areas of the app can be reached, ensuring fluid navigation throughout the educational experience.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
Once inside the dashboard, the user journey is divided into several key flows that correspond to the core functionalities of the application. The first detailed feature is the Conversational AI page. Here, students are able to enter queries or command prompts that are handled by large language models through the OpenRouter API. In this space, users not only conduct text-based interactions but can also engage in voice dialogues, thanks to the integration of OpenAI’s speech-to-text and voice dialogue capabilities. The transition between text and voice interaction is seamless; students can switch modes as needed without disruption. Another pivotal page is the RAG integration module. In this area, every interaction, whether recorded or transcribed, is stored in the Superbase server. This acts as a long-term memory system that supports retrieval-augmented generation. Each time a query is made, the AI refers to stored content—ensuring that previous class notes, lecture transcriptions, and teacher feedback are available to enhance context. Users also notice transitions to dedicated pages for recording class audio, converting speech to text in real-time, and even reviewing past interactions. Moreover, when it comes time to access full course content or advanced features, the app guides the user through a Stripe-integrated payment page where the subscription process is carried out. The flow across these feature pages remains consistent, with clear “back” or “home” options that always return the user to the central dashboard, ensuring they are never lost in the navigation process.

## Settings and Account Management
User control over personal information and subscriptions is managed in a dedicated Account Settings area. In this section, students can update their personal data, manage notification settings, and review their subscription details. Adjustments to user preferences are applied immediately once a change is made, and the system ensures that all information remains up-to-date and secure. This area also covers the billing and subscription management features integrated via Stripe. For example, should a student decide to shift from a free tier to a paid subscription, the settings page will provide a smooth transition where payment details can be securely entered and verified. Once changes are confirmed, the user is returned to the main application flow with clear signs that their subscription status has been updated. This ensures that the management of personal settings and account information is never a source of confusion or interruption in the educational experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
At every turn, the application is designed to gracefully handle potential errors. In situations where users enter incorrect login credentials or lose connectivity during an interaction, clear error messages are displayed that explain what went wrong and how to proceed. For instance, if the Google authentication fails or if the network connection drops during a voice dialogue session, the app immediately notifies the user with a friendly yet concise message. Similarly, when a payment error occurs on the Stripe page, users are provided with options to retry the transaction or contact support for further assistance. These error messages not only offer detailed explanations but also include links for troubleshooting or a means to restart the process. Alternate paths are built in so that even if one section fails, the system provides a clear route to continue, ensuring that no part of the user journey feels like a dead end.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
From the very first interaction on the landing page to the comprehensive dashboard and the detailed feature flows, the application is designed to support a smooth and integrated educational experience. A new student begins by using the Google sign-in process and proceeds through an onboarding that clearly explains the differences between free and paid user tiers. Once within the main interface, students can easily access course content, engage in dynamic conversations with the AI, and record classroom exchanges either via text or voice. Each interaction is captured and stored in the Superbase server to build a continuous learning reference, while the integration of payment via Stripe ensures easy access to premium content. The overall journey is underpinned by thoughtful error handling and consistent navigation paths, ensuring that users are never lost or confused. Ultimately, the app empowers students by providing advanced AI tools that enhance learning, making every session both interactive and memorable.
