# Implementation plan

Below is a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan with exact instructions and file paths, organized into phases. Each step includes a prevalidation check and cites the relevant sections from the project documents.

---

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. **Prevalidation**: Check if the current directory has already been initialized as a project (e.g., check for a package.json file or a `.cursor` folder).
   - Reference: Project Requirements: Environment Setup

2. **Node.js Setup**: Verify that Node.js is installed on your machine. If not, install Node.js (version as required by your project, e.g., latest LTS if not specified in project docs).
   - Command: `node -v`
   - Reference: Tech Stack: Frontend

3. **Python Setup**: Verify that Python is installed on your machine. If not, install the appropriate Python version.
   - Command: `python --version`
   - Reference: Tech Stack: Backend

4. **Cursor Metrics File**: In the project root, check if a file named `cursor_metrics.md` exists. If not, create it.
   - File: `/cursor_metrics.md`
   - Reference: Environment Setup (Cursor instructions)

5. **Create .cursor Directory**: In the project root, check for a `.cursor` directory. If it does not exist, create it.
   - Command (example): `mkdir .cursor`
   - Reference: Phase 1: Environment Setup (Cursor)

6. **Configure MCP for Supabase**: Within the `.cursor` directory, check if the file `mcp.json` exists. If not, create it and add the following configuration (with OS-specific instructions):
   - File: `/.cursor/mcp.json`
   - For macOS:
     ```json
     { "mcpServers": { "supabase": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "<connection-string>"] } } }
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```json
     { "mcpServers": { "supabase": { "command": "cmd", "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "<connection-string>"] } } }
     ```
   - Display this link to retrieve the connection string: [Supabase MCP connection guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp#connect-to-supabase-using-mcp)
   - Once the user has the connection string, replace `<connection-string>` accordingly.
   - Reference: Tech Stack: MCP, Environment Setup (Cursor)

7. **MCP Settings Check**: Open your IDEâ€™s MCP settings (for Cursor, navigate to Settings/MCP) and verify that the status displays green (active) after configuration.
