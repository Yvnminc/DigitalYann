# Progress

## Project Status Overview
DigitalYann is in the initial setup phase. The frontend foundation has been established with Next.js, but most core functionality is yet to be implemented.

## What Works
- Next.js project is set up and running in development mode
- Basic folder structure is in place (app, components, hooks, lib)
- Package dependencies are installed
- Tailwind CSS is configured for styling
- Basic layout components are set up using shadcn/ui
- TypeScript is enabled for type checking

## Work in Progress
- Landing page design and implementation
- Overall UI component structure
- Planning for backend services

2. Set up the Python backend environment and API structure
3. Implement Google OAuth authentication flow
4. Create the main dashboard layout
5. Start building the conversational AI interface

## General Notes
- The project is following the implementation plan from the PRD
- The frontend is using Next.js with TypeScript, React 19, and shadcn/ui components
- Initial focus is on establishing the core infrastructure before implementing specific features
