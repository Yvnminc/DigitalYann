# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
DigitalYann addresses the growing need for AI-enhanced educational tools that can improve both the teaching and learning experiences. Traditional note-taking and classroom interactions have limitations that can be overcome through modern AI technologies. This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a platform where AI can assist in capturing, retaining, and enhancing educational content.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Inefficient Note-Taking**: Students often struggle to capture comprehensive notes while staying engaged in classroom discussions. DigitalYann's real-time speech-to-text functionality allows automatic transcription of lectures, enabling students to focus on understanding rather than frantically writing.

2. **Limited Context Retention**: Traditional educational tools lack the ability to maintain context across multiple sessions. The RAG system in DigitalYann creates a persistent memory of educational content, enabling more contextually relevant responses and assistance.

3. **Accessibility Barriers**: Students with different learning needs often find traditional educational formats challenging. Voice interaction and AI-powered explanations provide alternative ways to engage with educational content.

4. **Disconnected Learning Tools**: Current educational technology often consists of separate, disconnected tools. DigitalYann provides an integrated platform where note-taking, AI assistance, and course content access are seamlessly connected.

5. **Classroom Recording Challenges**: Teachers who want to record classroom events for later review often face technical complications. DigitalYann simplifies this process with intuitive voice recording and transcription.

## How It Should Work
1. **Intuitive User Flow**: Users begin at a clean landing page where they authenticate using Google. After onboarding that explains the service tiers, they access a central dashboard that serves as the hub for all functionality.

2. **Seamless Interactions**: AI conversations should feel natural and contextually aware, drawing on previously stored knowledge to provide relevant responses and assistance.

3. **Transparent Data Usage**: All text interactions are automatically stored in the RAG system, building a growing knowledge base that improves the quality of AI responses over time.

4. **Clear Subscription Model**: Users understand the distinction between free (10 daily conversations) and paid ($50/month for unlimited) tiers, with smooth transition paths between them.

5. **Background Processing**: Complex operations like email sending and payment processing happen seamlessly in the background without disrupting the user experience.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: The interface should be clean, intuitive, and accessible to users with minimal technical skills.

2. **Responsiveness**: Real-time interactions, especially for speech-to-text and AI conversations, should feel immediate and natural.

3. **Reliability**: The platform should maintain consistent performance even during peak usage, with graceful error handling when issues arise.

4. **Educational Value**: Every interaction should contribute to the educational experience, whether through content delivery, note enhancement, or personalized assistance.

5. **Seamless Integration**: The various components (AI conversation, voice interaction, course content) should work together as a cohesive whole rather than feeling like separate tools.

6. **Accessibility**: The platform should be usable by people with different abilities and preferences, with support for both text and voice interactions.
